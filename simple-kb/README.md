## Directory Structure


Note: three files are mandated here but otherwise clients can do what
      they like here. The three files are:
(1) index.html
(2) files.lst
(3) index.json (created by the build process)


### Reminder to self: simple Git operations

~~~
git add --all
git commit -m "A description"
